/* Subject: CMPUT391
 * Assignment: Assignment 3
 * Authors: Michael Morris, William Kwan
 * 
 * Q9 (40 marks)
 * Write a program, in a file called q9.XYZ, where XYZ is the appropriate extension of your chosen programming language, that:
 * reads in two parameters from the command line: (1) the name of a SQLite database file containing an RDF graph and 
 * (2) a path to a file with a SPARQL query
 * prints the output of that query against that graph
 * For the sake of this assignment, you will deal with conjunctive SPARQL queries, without negation and without aggregations. 
 * At a minimum, your program must handle a fully specified query such as the one below, where the output is fully specified
 * by variables that are used among the graph patterns.
 * 
 * PREFIX p:<URI>
 * SELECT ?v1 ?v2 ... ?vn
 * WHERE {
 * subj1 pred1 obj1 .
 * ...
 * subjm predm objm
 * }
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 * There can be blank lines in the query file, consisting of zero or more space characters (e.g., \s or \t)
 * There can be zero or many PREFIX declarations, and that there will always be one SELECT ... WHERE statement in each query
 * Every PREFIX declaration comes in a separate line and before the SELECT statement
 * Every non-blank line inside the WHERE clause contains a single subj pred obj pattern or a single FILTER constraint
 * Every sub, pred, obj will be one of: a variable, a fully prefixed resource (predicate or entity), or a literal.
 * All literals in any query will be enclosed with double quotes, and only strings, integers, and decimal literals will be used.
 * If it helps, you may require that every variable in the SELECT appears in at least one pattern in the WHERE clause, and throw 
 *  an error otherwise. Also, you can assume that every regex filter will be of the form: FILTER (regex(?v, "<text>")), without
 *  any other operators.
